The InitialFullLoadBulkfile.py script appears to be designed for data extraction and loading from a MySQL database into a Snowflake data warehouse. Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionalities:

Key Libraries and Imports:
datetime: Used for handling dates and times.
json: Used for handling JSON data.
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
pymysql and mysql.connector: Used for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases.
snowflake.connector: Used for connecting to Snowflake.
Snowflake and MySQL Connections:
Snowflake Connection: The script establishes a connection to a Snowflake database using the snowflake.connector library.
MySQL Connection: The script also connects to a MySQL database using mysql.connector.
Main Functions and Operations:
load_to_stage(filefolder): A function that executes a given SQL statement in Snowflake, presumably to load data into a staging area.

Fetching Table Names:

The script fetches the names of the tables from the MySQL database schema db_1, excluding specific tables.
It uses the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES to get a list of tables, filtering out unwanted tables.
Data Extraction and JSON File Creation:

For each table, the script runs a SELECT * query to fetch all records from the table.
The records are fetched and stored in a list of dictionaries format using cursor.fetchall().
The script then creates a directory structure based on the current date and table name.
The records are intended to be written into a JSON file within this directory.
Observations:
Sensitive Information: The script contains hardcoded credentials (username, password, account). This is not a best practice and should be secured.
File Operations: The script generates directories and files dynamically based on the table name and current date.
I will now review the remaining content of this file to ensure we capture any additional details before moving on to the next file. ​​

Additional Details from the Code:
JSON File Writing:

The extracted records are written to a JSON file using json.dump. The file is created in the directory structure defined earlier.
Snowflake Commands:

PUT Command: After creating the JSON file, the script generates a PUT command to upload the file from the local system to a Snowflake stage.
Copy into Table: A COPY INTO command is prepared to load the data from the JSON file into the corresponding Snowflake table.
Refresh Pipe: The script also generates an ALTER PIPE command to refresh a Snowflake pipe, which is a Snowflake feature used for continuous data loading.
Final Execution:

The put_command is passed to the load_to_stage() function, which executes it to upload the file to Snowflake.
The load_json_raw command is executed to refresh the pipe for the specific table.
Summary of the First File:
The InitialFullLoadBulkfile.py script is designed to:

Extract data from MySQL tables.
Convert the data into JSON files.
Upload the JSON files to Snowflake.
Load the data into Snowflake tables.
