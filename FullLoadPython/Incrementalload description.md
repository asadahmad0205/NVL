The IncrementalDataLoad.py script is designed to capture and process changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) in a MySQL database and load this data incrementally into a Snowflake data warehouse. Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionalities:

Key Libraries and Imports:
pymysqlreplication: Used to read the binary log (binlog) of a MySQL database, which contains records of all changes made to the database.
datetime, json, pandas: Similar to the previous script, used for handling dates, JSON data, and data manipulation.
pymysql: Used for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases.
snowflake.connector: Used for connecting to Snowflake.
Snowflake and MySQL Connections:
Snowflake Connection: The script connects to a Snowflake database using the snowflake.connector library.
MySQL Settings: The script sets up the connection settings for MySQL, including the host, port, username, and password.
Main Functions and Operations:
BinLogStreamReader:

The script initializes a BinLogStreamReader object, which reads MySQL's binary log. This log tracks every change (insert, update, delete) in the database.
It filters for specific row events (DeleteRowsEvent, UpdateRowsEvent, WriteRowsEvent) to capture data modifications.
load_to_stage(filefolder):

Similar to the first script, this function executes a SQL command in Snowflake.
Current Binlog File and Position:

The script prints the current binlog file and its position, which are crucial for ensuring that incremental loads pick up exactly where the previous load left off.
Rename_table_column Function:

This function renames a key in a nested dictionary, which is likely used to align the data with Snowflake's schema.
Binlog Event Processing:

The script reads the binlog stream and processes each event.
The events include changes to the database, which the script captures and processes for loading into Snowflake.
